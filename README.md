# ternary-projective-relations
A ternary constraint network implementation for Clementini's ternary projective relations.

## First runnable version:
This version allows the user to input 3 regions and retrieve a Clementini's plan partition. 
The input regions are in the form of (R1, R2, R3) and the system is able to recognize the relation between R1 and the plan partition generated by R2 R3 regions.
